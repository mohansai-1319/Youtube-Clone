# Youtube-Clone
This repository contains a simple YouTube clone interface created using only HTML and CSS. It mimics the structure and basic layout of YouTube's homepage, featuring video thumbnails, a navigation bar. This project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate how to build a basic webpage layout similar to YouTube using front-end web technologies.
